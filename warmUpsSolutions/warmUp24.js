// Create an HTML, CSS, JS files and connect them together.
// Create a text field and a button below it in HTML file
// Create an empty unordered list  below the button
// Create two CSS classes, each with a different color property
// Using jQuery, create a function, that takes the input from the text field, creates a list item and add it to the unordered list, then add a class to the added item alternatively (So first time Class1 then next time Class2 then Class1 and repeat)
// Good Luck!
